This project was created to provid a way for me to sort flags from all over the World to sort and to study. (I'm a big fan of flags!)

The /res folder contains all the flag images with ther respected info json-file.
It also contains a folder for costom sets of flags you can coose from to study.

How to use: (very simple)
 - First you select one or more of the costom sets and press play!
 - Use space to reveal the answer and to continue
 - Have fun!
